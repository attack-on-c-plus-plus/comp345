# COMP 345

## Git basics

Please always do your work on a branch (you can also create branch via your IDE if you prefer)
```
git checkout -b <issue-name>
```

Edit your code, then once done commit your work (you can also commit your changes via your IDE if you prefer)
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```

Push your changes to GitHub (you can do this via your IDE if you prefer)
```
git push --ff-only
```

Create a pull request (on GitHub.com) linked to the issue (for which the branch was created) and request a code review. Usually best 2 people review and approve.

Once reviews are done it can be merged.

To get the latest changes on the repository do a Pull
```
git pull
```

Thank you.
